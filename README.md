# poetsite

This website is the first project for the Code Institute's classroom bootcamp. It is a fully responsive static front-end only app built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript - no template was used.

## Design

The websites uses a one-page design but incorporates the content of 5 pages. This makes for a more modern feel with faster load time across the whole website. 

Bootstrap 3 is used to make the website responsive for all media screen sizes.

The navbar contains the site logo and links to sections. It is designed to collapse when the screen size is that of a mobile phone.

Jquery and javascript are used to allow for smooth scrolling when links are clicked within the page.

There is a large 'hero' image at the top of the page with a picture of the Poet, social media links and an input area to sign up for a newsletter. This form isn't active on the backend and only indicates positioning of the input.

Below the Hero image there are three large links 'watch', 'listen', 'read'. These links draw the user into the key areas of the site.

Sections are divided by large quotes in <h2> to give the user a feel for the poets content / poetry.

The 'About' section contains a colour image of the poet and text detailing the background of the poet. 

The 'Interviews' section contains 4 external links to relevant websites related to the poet.

The 'poetry' section contains six poems which are bootstrap modal data-toggles. Each poem is represented by a stylised bookcover using the Tily Hover effect detailed below.

The 'multimedia' section conatins a youtube video of the poet accepting an award and an audio file. Both media elements have corresponding controls.

The 'contact me' section conatins a contact form and an image of the poet. The contact form is for layout purposes only and is not functional subject to future development.
